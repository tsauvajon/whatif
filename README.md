This app, built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[iced](https://iced.rs/).

To run, just run `cargo run` - the only dependency is Rust
([install here](https://rustup.rs/)). I'm planning on hosting it at some point.

Since I couldn't find a free-tier API for historical data, I just downloaded a
CSV.
There will be gaps in data between 06 March 2024 and today. In a future version
I might store things in a database, but right now it's not a priority.
